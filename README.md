# Advertisement-With-Multiple-Animations
A small VHDL project that can display animated text on the 7-segment displays of an FPGA board that I made for my Digital Systems Design course back in 2021. There is a selection of eight possible animation regimes that the user can choose from, by using the switches of the FPGA board.

Further information regarding the implementation of this project, along with images and gifs presenting the obtained results can be found in the attached documentation.
